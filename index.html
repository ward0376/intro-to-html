            <img src="images/strawberrypicking.jpg" alt="Girl kneeling down picking strawberries on a summer day">

            <p>My name is Victoria Ward. I am a first-year student in the graphic design program at Algonquin College. I live in the South end of Ottawa, and work in retail.</p>

            <p>The first two semesters of the graphic design program at Algonquin College have felt so welcoming, and I have already learned so much. I was nervous at first that the program would be different or more difficult than I imagined, but it is so much more enjoyable to me than I could have imagined.</p>
